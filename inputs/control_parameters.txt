#COMMENTS
# This software is intented to be fully automated, aimed at producing science-quality output with a 
# single command line with zero user interference for CUTE data. 
# It can be easily used for single order spectral data in any wavelength without any modification. 
#
#01. Path locations: 
#		Data path: Path location of input data.
#		Intermediate file path (temp_path): Path location to save intermediate files produced.
#		Output file path: Path location to save output files.  
#		If data path is not provided it is assumed to be the current directory.
#		If intermediate file path and output file path are not provided they are created with names
#       temp and output respectively in the data path.
#02. The user has the option to select individual steps during reduction. The options are as 
#		follows:
#		hb_correction,create_mbias,create_mdark,create_mflat,cr_bias,cr_dark,cr_flat,cr_cosmic,
#       extract,bg_sub,wcalib,fluxcalib,light_curve,retrieval,level3,all
#		hb_correction: Hot and bad pixel correction.
#		create_mbias: Create master bias.
#		create_mdark: Create master dark.
#		create_mflat: Create master flat.
#		cr_bias: Correct for bias in science frames.
#		cr_dark: Correct for dark in science frames.
#		cr_flat: Correct for flat in science frames.
#		cr_cosmic: Correct for cosmic rays in science frames.
#		extract: Define the trace and extract the spectrum.
#		bg_sub: Subtract background from the spectrum.
#		wcalib: Do wavelength calibration.
#		fluxcalib: Do Flux calibration.
#		light_curve: Create three light curves form the data.
#		level3: Carry out all processes required for generating Level 3 data of CUTE, ie.,  
#				flux and wavelength calibrated 1-D spectra. 
#		all: Execute all the steps mentioned above. This is also the default option if steps 
#			 keyword is absent.
#03. Location of hot and bad pixel map. The location of the map of cosmetic defects on the CCD as
#       a FITS file with the same size as the input CCD frame 
#		byte-type pixels (8-bit) and values of 0B for good pixels and 1B for bad ones. 
#04. Location of master calibration files if available.
#		This includes locations of master bias, master dark and/or master flat frames (fits files). 
#05. Set save_temp_files equal to 1 if you need all the intermediate files to be saved to the 
#		intermediate file directory.
#06. Option for Hot and bad pixel correction
#		hbpix_corection_type: Hot and bad pixel correction can be made by interpolation or by 
#		averaging options for type are interpolate or average 
#07. Options for master file creation.
#		Statistical method to create master files. Options are: 'median', 'mean' or 'mode'
#		Threshold for rejection of pixels: sigma_deviation 
#		(how many sigma's from mean value of the frame).
#		Saturation_level sets the saturation limit of CCD. If not set default of 72000 is used.	
#08. Cosmic Ray correction options: Level of cosmic ray clipping for LA cosmic algorithm. 
#		Default value set by the code is 8. 
#		Set cosmic_before_dark to 1 to carryout cosmic ray correction before dark correction, 
#		default is to carryout cosmic ray correction after dark correction.		
#09. Trace parameters
#		Degree for centroid polynomial: Default is 1.
#		Trace type used for extraction. The options are: 'simple','fixed','variable','function'. 
#		For details of these options refer to the manual.
#		Additional parameters required for different trace options:
#			centroid  : Centroid will be calculated if not provided
#			slope	  : Required for option: simple and fixed, defines the slope of the spectrum 
#			width 	  : Required for option: simple, which defines the width of the spectrum 
#			upper 	  : Required for option: fixed, which defines the upper width of the spectrum 
#			lower 	  : Required for option: fixed, which defines the lower width of the spectrum 
#			threshold :	Required for option: variable or function, which defines the threshold from
#											 the maximum/peak of the spectrum. 
#		 Background trace: File location for information of where to extract background. 
#						   The user could also provide it as numbers corresponding to the shift in 
#                          pixels from centroid. 
#		 Eg of usage: If only one number is provided the background for eg.,'x', 
#                     Background is extracted similar to spectrum with the centroid of the 
#                     background as spectrum_centroid+x and spectrum_centroid-x. If multiple 
#                     numbers are specified as 'x,y,-z' the background spectrum is extracted 
#                     along the pixels spectrum_centroid+x, spectrum_centroid+y,spectrum_centroid-z 
#		              and scaled to spectrum extrazion size.   
#10. Wavelength calibration variables
#		Type of wavelength calibration required: Options are 'simple' and 'crscor'
#		Location of wavelength file. A text file with length equal to number of pixels in dispersion
#       direction representing wavelength to pixel mapping.
#		For cross-correlation, A location a two column model file of wavelength vs flux should be
#       provided as model_file. 
#		Another option is to provide the location of synthetic spectrum library. CONTROL assumes 
#       that folder are named by their temperature and file are named as model.flx. 
#		The second  option would require the user to provide stellar parameters like temperature and
#		radius. 
#       Required only for the option crscor so as to compare with a model data. 
#11. Flux calibration variables
#		Location of flux calibration file which provides wavelength vs response relation.
#
#**************************************************************************************************
# The program works in a series of steps following standard CCD reduction techniques user can also 
# select individual modules using the step function described above.
# A reduction log is created to help users with processes carried out and mentioning the different
# parameters used if any.
# The steps involved in the program execution are as follows:
#
#		1. Prepare: Check for the different input parameters are set variables accordingly. 
#			If data files are present classify them according to file type.
#		2. Hot and bad pixel correction: Correct for hot and bad pixels in the frames.
#		3. Create master bias: Create a master bias if master bias file is not found from a set of 
#			bias files.
#		4. Create master dark: Create a master dark if master dark file is not found from a set of 
#			dark files.
#		5. Create master flat: Create a master flat if master flat file is not found from a set of 
#			flat files.
#		6. Correct for bias: Correct of the effect of bias in science frames.
#		7. Correct for dark: Correct of the effect of dark in science frames.
#		8. Correct for flat: Correct of the effect of flat in science frames.
#		9. Correct for cosmic rays: Correct for the effect of cosmic rays using LA cosmic algorithm. 
#		10.Extract spectrum: Define spectrum trace and extract the spectrum.
#		11.Subtract Background: Subtract background from spectrum.
#		12.Wavelength calibration: Do wavelength calibration
